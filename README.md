# ParkingSlotBooking
An intuitive application that gives users the ability to reserve parking spaces for their vehicles in advance at a variety of different locations, in order to increase their sense of security when travelling to congested areas during the epidemic. Users are also given the ability to schedule other services to help daily wage employees, such as those who provide vehicle washing, dry cleaning, and repair services.Â 

Implemented this web application with Spring Boot, REST API, CSS and Thymeleaf.

This is the course project for the Object Oriented Programming Course.
